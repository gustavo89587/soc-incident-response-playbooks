# Malware Alert Triage

## Incident Scenario
Endpoint security tool reports malware detection.

## Detection
- Antivirus or EDR malware alert
- File hash, behavior, or signature match

## Analysis
Validate alert by checking:
- Was the file quarantined or blocked?
- Is the file known benign?
- Any signs of persistence or lateral movement?

## Risk Assessment
Varies based on malware type and execution status.

## Response Actions
1. Confirm containment status
2. Isolate endpoint if malware executed
3. Remove malicious artifacts
4. Monitor for reinfection

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
- TA0002 – Execution  
- TA0008 – Lateral Movement (if applicable)

## Lessons Learned
- Improve alert context (blocked vs executed)
- Reduce false positives through tuning
