## 🧠 How I Decide Under Pressure
When analyzing SOC alerts, I follow a simple mental model:

1. **Sequence over single events**  
2. **Context over severity score**  
3. **Containment with control, not panic**  
4. **Preserve evidence whenever possible**

This approach helps reduce false positives, avoid unnecessary disruption,
and focus response efforts where real risk exists.
